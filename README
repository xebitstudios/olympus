This repository is about OLYMPUS - RetailNode's Store Layout Generator Service.

The basic parameters needed to set up a custom floor layout and configuration
To use when setting up the model inside the associated OlympusDB database service is as follows:
	
	L => The floor length of the store
	B => The floor breadth of the store
	LS => The number of shelves along the left wall of the store
	RS => The number of shelves along the right wall of the store
	BS => The number of shelves along the back wall of the store
	MSB => The number of shelf rows along the breadth of the store
	MSL => The number of shelf rows along the length of the store
	NC => The number of checkout counters in the store
	ND => The number of multi-directional (entry/exit) doors in the store
	NZ => The number of zones the store is divided into
	GR => The number of guest rooms in the store

The default store configuration
When Olympus is called without passing in any or some parameters
is shown below:

	L = 20
	B = 17
	LS = 12
	RS = 12
	BS = 18
	MSB = 6
	MSL = 2
	NC = 5
	ND = 5
	NZ = 12
	GR = 0

What does Olympus do?
Olympus is mainly meant to deliver a store layout map that helps:
	- The store product generator and placement service (SPGPS) uses to stock the shelves with products.
	- The customer shopping path planner service (CSPPS) uses to generate the paths a customer will take when completing a shopping trip.
	- The store zone configuration service (SZCS) uses in keeping track of zone counts and activities.
	- The shopper generation service (SGS) will need to instantiate a shopper's initial location upon arrival at the store.

What other service does Olympus interact with?
Olympus mainly interacts with a single service, OlympusDB. This is the database service that stores Olympus's final configuration, allowing all other services to obtain layout details as needed.
